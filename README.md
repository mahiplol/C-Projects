The source code for this project is in the Movie Theater DataBase Branch
I have used C/C++ for the project as well as Unix so that this project runs on a gaul server as well!

Following things have been done to make sure this project works smoothly:

 • Developed a dynamic movie and actor database using linked lists and pointers, ensuring efficient data storage and
 retrieval.
 • Implemented key functionalities for user interaction, including adding, removing, searching, and listing movies and
 actors, enhancing the usability of the system for comprehensive database management.
 • Deployed the system on a Unix Gaul server, enabling remote execution and management of the database,
 optimizing accessibility and performance
